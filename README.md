Small tutorial code that performs image segmentation using Unet architecture.

A lot of it was adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/code/sudhupandey/cityscape-segmentation-unet-pytorch with some modification.
 
Cross Entropy loss on validation set with this emplementation goes down to 0.3ish with 100 epchs.
